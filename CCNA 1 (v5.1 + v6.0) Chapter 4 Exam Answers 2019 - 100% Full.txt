Which two factors may interfere with the copper cabling and result in signal distortion and data corruption? (Choose two.)
A: EMI*
A: RFI*
Q: Explain:

Q: Which type of connector does a network interface card use?
A: RJ-45*
Q: What is one advantage of using fiber optic cabling rather than copper cabling?
A: It is able to carry signals much farther than copper cabling.*
Q: Explain:
Q: Why are two strands of fiber used for a single fiber optic connection?
A: They allow for full-duplex connectivity.*
Q: Explain:
Q: A network administrator is designing the layout of a new wireless network. Which three areas of concern should be accounted for when building a wireless network? (Choose three.)

A: data link*
Q: Explain:
Q: What are two services performed by the data link layer of the OSI model? (Choose two.)
A: It accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into frames. *
A: It provides media access control and performs error detection.*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is true concerning physical and logical topologies?
A: Logical topologies refer to how a network transfers data between devices.*
Q: Explain:
Q: Which method of data transfer allows information to be sent and received at the same time?
A:  full duplex*
Q: Which statement describes an extended star topology?
A: End devices connect to a central intermediate device, which in turn connects to other central intermediate devices.*
Q: Explain:
Q: Refer to the exhibit. Which statement describes the media access control methods that are used by the networks in the exhibit?
A: Network 1 uses CSMA/CD and Network 3 uses CSMA/CA.*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is contained in the trailer of a data-link frame?
A: error detection*
Q: Explain:
Q: As data travels on the media in a stream of 1s and 0s how does a receiving node identify the beginning and end of a frame?
A: The transmitting node inserts start and stop bits into the frame.*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is a role of the Logical Link Control sublayer?
A: to mark frames to identify the network layer protocol being carried*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is the definition of bandwidth?
A: the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is the function of the CRC value that is found in the FCS field of a frame?

Q: Explain:
Q: What are two examples of hybrid topologies? (Choose two.)
A: partial mesh*
A: extended star*
Q: Explain:
Q: Which statement describes signaling at the physical layer?
A:  Sending the signals asynchronously means that they are transmitted without a clock signal.*
Q: The throughput of a FastEthernet network is 80 Mb/s. The traffic overhead for establishing sessions, acknowledgments, and encapsulation is 15 Mb/s for the same time period. What is the goodput for this network?
A: 65 Mb/s*
Q: How is the magnetic field cancellation effect enhanced in UTP cables?
A: by increasing and varying the number of twists in each wire pair*
Q: Which statement is correct about multimode fiber?
A: SC-SC patch cords are used with multimode fiber cables.*

A: 802.11ac*
Q: What is one main characteristic of the data link layer?
