A: CBWFQ*
Q: Which queuing algorithm has only a single queue and treats all packets equally?
A: FIFO*

A: It treats all network packets in the same way.*
A: It does not provide a delivery guarantee for packets.*
Q: What role do network devices play in the IntServ QoS model?
A: Network devices ensure that resources are available before traffic is allowed to be sent by a host through the network.*
Q: Which QoS model is very resource intensive and provides the highest guarantee of QoS?
A: IntServ*
Q: In QoS models, which type of traffic is commonly provided the most preferential treatment over all other application traffic?
A: voice traffic*
Q: What are two approaches to prevent packet loss due to congestion on an interface? (Choose two.)
A: Increase link capacity.*

A: Type of Service*
A: Traffic Class*
Q: What is the benefit of deploying Layer 3 QoS marking across an enterprise network?
A: Layer 3 marking can carry the QoS information end-to-end.*
Q: Which QoS technology provides congestion avoidance by allowing TCP traffic to be throttled before buffers become full and tail drops occur?
A: weighted random early detection*
Q: Refer to the exhibit. As traffic is forwarded out an egress interface with QoS treatment, which congestion avoidance technique is used?
A: traffic policing*
Q: Which QoS model uses the DSCP bits to mark packets and provides 64 possible classes of service?
A: DiffServ*
Q: Which QoS technique retains excess packets in a separate queue for later transmission?
A: shaping*
Q: What are two disadvantages of employing teleworkers in an organization? (Choose two.)
A: increased difficulty of tracking task progress*

A: DSL is not a shared medium.*
Q: Which medium is used for delivering data via DSL technology through PSTN?
A: copper*
Q: How is voice traffic affected when the customer uses ADSL technology?
