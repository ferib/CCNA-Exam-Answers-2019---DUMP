Q: Explain:
Q: Refer to the exhibit. The exhibit shows a small switched network and the contents of the MAC address table of the switch. PC1 has sent a frame addressed to PC3. What will the switch do with the frame?

Q: Explain:
Q: What is auto-MDIX?
A: a feature that detects Ethernet cable type*
Q: Explain:
Q: Refer to the exhibit. PC1 issues an ARP request because it needs to send a packet to PC2. In this scenario, what will happen next?
A:  PC2 will send an ARP reply with its MAC address.*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is the aim of an ARP spoofing attack?
A: to associate IP addresses to the wrong MAC address*
Q: What is a characteristic of port-based memory buffering?
A: Frames are buffered in queues linked to specific ports.*
Q: Explain:
Q: What is the minimum Ethernet frame size that will not be discarded by the receiver as a runt frame?
A: 64 bytes*
Q: What are two potential network problems that can result from ARP operation? (Choose two.)
A: On large networks with low bandwidth, multiple ARP broadcasts could cause data communication delays. *
A: Network attackers could manipulate MAC address and IP address mappings in ARP messages with the intent of intercepting network traffic.*
Q: Explain:
Q: Fill in the blank.
Q: RUNT 
Q: Explain:
Q: Fill in the blank.
Q: port-based
Q: Fill in the blank.
Q: spoofing
Q: Explain:
Q: Which statement describes the treatment of ARP requests on the local link?
A: They are received and processed by every device on the local network.*
Q: Refer to the exhibit. The switches are in their default configuration. Host A needs to communicate with host D, but host A does not have the MAC address for its default gateway. Which network hosts will receive the ARP request sent by host A?
A: only hosts B, C, and router R1*
Q: Explain:
Q: Refer to the exhibit.
Q: A switch with a default configuration connects four hosts. The ARP table for host A is shown. What happens when host A wants to send an IP packet to host D?
A: Host A sends out a broadcast of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Every other host connected to the switch receives the broadcast and host D responds with its MAC address.*
Q: Explain:
Q: True or False?
Q: When a device is sending data to another device on a remote network, the Ethernet frame is sent to the MAC address of the default gateway.
A: true*
Q: Explain:
Q: The ARP table in a switch maps which two types of address together?
A: Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address*
Q: Explain:
Q: Match the characteristic to the forwarding method. (Not all options are used.)
Q: Sort elements
Q: cut-through (A) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">low latency (A)*</span>
Q: cut-through (B) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">may forward runt frames (B)*</span>
Q: cut-through (C) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">begins forwarding when the destination address is received (C)*</span>
Q: store-and-forward (D) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">always stores the entire frame (D)*</span>
Q: store-and-forward (E) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">checks the CRC before forwarding (E)*</span>
Q: store-and-forward (F) -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">checks the frame length before forwarding (F)</span>
Q: Explain:
Q: What is a characteristic of a contention-based access method?
A: It is a nondeterministic method.*
Q: What is the purpose of the preamble in an Ethernet frame?
A: is used for timing synchronization*
Q: What is the Layer 2 multicast MAC address that corresponds to the Layer 3 IPv4 multicast address 224.139.34.56?
A: 01-00-5E-0B-22-38*
Q: Which two statements are correct about MAC and IP addresses during data transmission if NAT is not involved? (Choose two.)
A: Destination and source MAC addresses have local significance and change every time a frame goes from one LAN to another. *
A: Destination IP addresses in a packet header remain constant along the entire path to a target host.*
Q: What are two features of ARP? (Choose two.)
A: If a host is ready to send a packet to a local destination device and it has the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination, it generates an ARP broadcast.*
A: If a device receiving an ARP request has the destination IPv4 address, it responds with an ARP reply.*
Q: A host is trying to send a packet to a device on a remote LAN segment, but there are currently no mappings in its ARP cache. How will the device obtain a destination MAC address?
A: It will send an ARP request for the MAC address of the default gateway. *
A: <span style="color: #000000;">It will send the frame and use its own MAC address as the destination.</span> *
