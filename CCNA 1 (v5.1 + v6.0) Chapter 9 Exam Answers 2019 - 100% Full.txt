Q: Explain:
Q: What happens if the first packet of a TFTP transfer is lost?

Q: Explain:
Q: A host device is receiving live streaming video. How does the device account for video data that is lost during transmission?
A: The device will continue receiving the streaming video, but there may be a momentary disruption.*
Q: Explain:
Q: Why does HTTP use TCP as the transport layer protocol?
A: because HTTP requires reliable delivery*
Q: Explain:
Q: When is UDP preferred to TCP?
